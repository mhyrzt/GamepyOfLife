<br>
so at first sorry for my bad english :)))
<br>
so ofcourse you need python3 and pygame which you can install with this command easily:<br>
    <code>
    $ sudo apt install python3-pygame 
    </code><br>
this is simple program with 4 python file:<br>
    <ul>
        <li> main.py -> execute the game </li>
        <li> cell.py </li>
        <li> playground.py </li>
        <li> consts.py -> you can configure settings of the game such as screen size and etc. </li>
    </ul>
