Conway Game of Life visualized with pygame

so at first sorry for my bad english :)))

so ofcourse you need python3 and pygame which you can install with this command easily:
    $ sudo apt install python3-pygame 

this is simple program with 4 python file:
    - main.py -> execute the game
    - cell.py
    - playground.py
    - consts.py -> you can configure settings of the game such as screen size and etc.
